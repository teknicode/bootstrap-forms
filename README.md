## Simple Form Generator

This simple class allows fast generation of html forms with Bootstrap styling.

### Installation

```
composer require teknicode/bootstrap-forms
```

### Usage

```
require("src/Form.php");
use Teknicode\Form\Form;

$form = new Form();
```

Now you're ready to generate a form.
Open the form and pass in an array containing attributes to be included in the form tag. If you don't provide an action attribute the form will submit to its current url.

```
$form->open([
    "id" => "my_form",
    "action" => "my url"
]);
```

Outputs `<form action="my url" id="my_form">`

Add an input to the form. The int in `input(1)` defines the width of the input according to Bootstraps Grid system. For example `input(6)` will set the input width to `col-md-6`.

```
$form->input(1)->set([
    "name"=>"my_first_input",
    "type"=>"text",
    "value" => "The current value of the input",
    "label" => "My First Input"
]);
```

Outputs `<input type="text" name="my_first_input" value="The current value of the input"/>` wrapped with a label.

To add a select.

```
$form->select(2)->set([
    "name"=>"my_select",
    "label"=>"My Select",
    "value" => "option3",
    "options" => [
        "First Group Test"=>"--group--",
        "Option 1" => [
            "value" => "option1",
            "custom-option-attribute" => "attribute value"
        ],
        "Option 2" => "option2",
        "Second Group Test"=>"--group--",
        "Option 3" => "option3",
        "Option 4" => "option4"
    ]
]);
```

Radio button also require an array of options.

```
$form->input(1)->set([
    "name"=>"my_radio",
    "type" => "radio",
    "value" => "value2",
    "label" => "This is a radio button",
    "options" => [
        "option 1" => "value1",
        "option 2" => "value2"
    ]
]);
```

The value attribute will pre select the option from those provided in the options array.

Add html or a spacer.

```
$form->html(
    6, //grid width
    '<b>My Content</b>'
);
```

Add a button.

```
$form->button(1)->set([
    "text"=>"My Button",
    "class"=>"btn-lg btn-primary"
]);
```

Now simply output the form.

`echo $form->compile()`

## Catch and Process Posted Data

Initialize the class object

```
use Teknicode\Form\Process;
$process = new Process("mail" or "sms"); //mail is default
```
Provide settings using the set method as show below:
```
$process->set("recipient","email@address.co.uk" /*string or array of strings*/ );
$process->set("from",["address"=>"sender@address.co.uk","name"=>"Sender Name"]);
```
Setup SMTP credentials - skip this to send with mail()
```
$process->set("smtp",[
  "Host"=>"mailerserver.url.com",
  "Username"=>"email@username",
  "Password"=>"AccountPassword",
  "SSL"=>"tls",
  "Port"=>587
]);
```
If you are using SMS, you must provide the following AWS credentials:
```
$process->set("aws", [
   "aws_access_key_id" => "",
   "aws_secret_access_key" => "",
   "default_region" => "eu-west-1",
   "sms_sender_id" => ""
]);

//you would then provide a mobile number in recipient including the country code:
$process->set("recipient","+4407123456789");
```
If you are using MySQLi, you must provide the following credentials:
```
$process->set("mysqli", [
   "host" => "",
   "username" => "",
   "password" => "",
   "database" => "",
   "table" => ""
]);

//you would then provide the values to be set:
$process->set("values",[
  "field name" => "value"
]]);

//to update an existing entry provide the id
$process->set("id",INT);

```

Now all thats needed is to catch the post!
```
$send = $process->catch();

if( $send['status']=="failed" ){
  //do something with the error message
  echo $send['error'];
}
```
The catch method will parse the posted data and create a simple clean email containing the name of the input and value set.

$process->set("recipient",STRING | ARRAY OF STRINGS);

$process->set("from",["address"=>STRING,"name"=>STRING]);

$process->set("subject",STRING);

   "aws_secret_access_key" => "",
   "default_region" => "eu-west-1",
   "sms_sender_id" => ""
]);
```

```
$process->set("id",INT); //optional for update instead of insert

$process->set("mysqli", [
   "host" => "",
   "username" => "",
